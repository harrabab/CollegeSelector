					<h1>Waterloo</h1>
					<p>Waterloo is a city in Ontario, Canada. It is the smallest of three cities in the Regional
						Municipality of Waterloo (and previously in Waterloo County, Ontario), and is adjacent to the
						city of Kitchener.

						Kitchener and Waterloo are often jointly referred to as "Kitchenerâ€“Waterloo", "KW", or the "Twin
						Cities" (when the reference includes the nearby city of Cambridge, Ontario, the term
						"Tri-Cities" or "the Tri-City" are used). While there were several unsuccessful attempts to
						combine the municipalities of Kitchener and Waterloo, following the 1973 establishment of the
						Region of Waterloo there was less motivation to do so. At the time of the 2016 census, the
						population of Waterloo was 104,986.[1]</p>
